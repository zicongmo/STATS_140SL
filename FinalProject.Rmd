########## LIBRARIES ##########
library(dplyr) # data preprocessing
library(glmnet) # ridge, lasso 
library(caret) # train

library(randomForest)

########## HELPER FUNCTIONS ##########
# For each element of p, return the dollar amount represented by the element
from_dollar = function(p) {
    return(as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '', p)))
}

# For each element of b, return TRUE if b is exactly 't'

# For each element of s, return the number of elements of s if s were casted to list
# Bug: Empty elements are still counted, meaning that "{}" returns 1 and "{,}" returns 2
# This is really jank, but too lazy to fix this

########## DATA READ AND CLEANING ##########
# Read in all data
airbnb_all <- read.csv("listings.csv")

apartment_all <- airbnb_all

# Select all columns that could potentially be useful in a bad linear regression
# In particular, exclude:
# 1. identifying information (e.g. id) We'll keep listing_url to look up potential outliers later
# 2. host inputted information (e.g. name, summary, space, description)
# 3. columns that duplicate information (e.g. market, latitude, longitude, neighborhood)

# Potential predictors to add: 
# host_neighbourhood == neighbourhood_cleansed
# Amount of time that host has been a host (cleaned host_since)
# NLP information about the host inputted columns

# Looking at the prices, some people are clearly delusional
# https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21801886
# However, manually going through the data to remove these outliers is also super annoying, so we just won't do it :)
# https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24858061 has 110 amenities, but is no longer actively listed
# A lot of people with lots of amenities are just double listing them (e.g. TV, "Cable TV") or on something ("Host greets you", "Well-lit path to entrance")
# Again, manually going through is difficult, so we'll just leave the data but keep this fact in mind
# Finally, some hosts are waaay more experienced than other ones (some have >1000 listings in multiple states)
# It's difficult to find a basis to exclude them, so again we just leave the data
# One way to potentially get rid of dumb people is to filter by availability_365 < 365
# Rows with 365 availability have never been rented before, which can be related to the fact that their hosts are way overvaluing their properties
# summary(apartment_casted)

# Omit all NA's. This isn't necessary for lm, but potentially necessary for other models if we want to try other models
# Remove all airbnbs that have never been rented before
# Remove listing_url, price for model fitting convenience

# To be honest, I don't really remember what this code does
